<p>The work aims above all the scope of filling the technological gap still today preventing an effective digital dialogue between production and construction chains. Unfortunately, such a dialog is traditionally based on documentation, no matter if printed or digital, which for the most cases is not digitally computable.</p>
<p>A secondary work objective is to constitute itself as a syntax suitable for the digital management of the contents requested by the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) which lays down harmonized rules for the distribution of construction products in the EU market, particularly covering demand of comparison of products performance, characteristics, certification, CE marking and conformity declarations. </p>
<p>The smart transport of construction objects data needs a clear and common understanding of the format to express the structure and the data. The data can be transferred in several ways, e.g. via direct database connect, or via webservices or file transfer. In all cases, the sender and the receiver of the product data need a basic standard to implement the data transfer.</p>
<p>The digital transformation of the construction industry fully interests the production chain of construction involving related activities as manufacturing, certification, promotion, marketing, procurement, selection, supply, transportation, transformation, assembly, installation, maintenance and replacement over the time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the supply chain of construction needs a complete digitalization of information transactions sharing \<em>data\</em> and product \<em>characteristics\</em>. Hopefully, the above-mentioned supply chain should comply to the digital standards conventionally used in the design, construction and maintenance stages.</p>
<p>Digital models and other information containers, functional to the construction world, need to be read and nurtured, both in input and output, using a suitable, standardized and accepted digital syntax. This will grant the modernization and automatization of dialogues that will eventually and gradually evolve into the so-called <em>machine-to-machine</em> transactions.
This standard contains of two parts.</p>
