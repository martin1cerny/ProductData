<h2 class="std">5.3 IfcProductExtension</h2>
<h3 class="std">5.3.1 Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The <i>IfcProductExtension</i> further specialises the concepts of a (physical) product, i.e. a component likely to have a shape and a placement within the project context. The product information is provided for individual product occurrences as subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>, and for common specific product types as subtypes of <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifctypeproduct.htm">IfcTypeProduct</a>. Both definitions are rooted in supertypes provided within the <i>IfcKernel</i>. Basis concepts, introduced within the <i>IfcProductExtension</i>, are:</p>
<p>\\* the spatial project structure,
\\* the element,
\\* the grid,
\\* the port, and 
\\* the annotation.</p>
<p>The spatial project structure defines</p>
<p>\\* the site, 
\\* the building, 
\\* the building storey, and 
\\* the space </p>
<p>and its decomposition structure. In addition the concepts of system and zone are introduced within the <i>IfcProductExtension</i>. Relationships between the spatial structure and the elements are defined, such as spatial containment and space boundaries.</p>
<p>An element is assigned to the spatial project structure and may refer by its placement to a grid. Basic types of elements, which are introduced are</p>
<p>\\* building element
\\* opening element
\\* furnishing element
\\* distribution element (including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical and equipment elements)
\\* transportation element</p>
<p>The other concepts introduced are</p>
<p>\\* a grid, providing a contraint placement for elements, 
\\* an annotation to capture any additional annotations to a building model or plan (such as explanatory text, dimensioning, etc.), and
\\* a port, providing connectivity between elements.</p>
