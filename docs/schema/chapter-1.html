<h1 class="num" id="scope">Scope</h1>
<p>The scope of this standard is to define the syntactic characteristics of a generic structure, to transport data about construction objects based on EN ISO 16739-1:2018, prEN ISO 23386 and prEN ISO 23387.
The application of this standard will allow all stakeholders in the construction industry  to structure, govern, update, maintain and transport their information about construction objects (e.g. product data) through a machine-readable format.
In addition, several stakeholders of the process will be able to take the most out from their software technologies, avoiding data replication as well as saving time and improving both quality and transparency. The scenario within which this standard will apply will affects producers, designers, constructors, facility and property managers.
The syntactic approach considers as primary objective the ability to re-use specifications given in the international standard EN ISO 16739-1:2018. This specific goal is going to be reached by the delivery the Model View Definition “Construction Objects Data View” (COD) which will be made available alongside the others MVD already issued.
Software houses and software application developers can use this standard to implement interfaces for importing and exporting constructions object based on the official standard EN ISO 16739-1:2018.</p>
